# Description
This folder contains ready-to-run 2-dimensional OpenSEES models of five archetype steel buildings designed with perimeter special moment frames (SMFs), with heights of 2, 4, 8, 12 and 20-story.

# Important note
These models were developed back in 2019. There has been several updates since then including new hysteretic models and modeling guidelines for steel members and connections. To generate frame models with these updated modeling specifications, you should use the FM-2D software (https://github.com/amaelkady/FM-2D).
